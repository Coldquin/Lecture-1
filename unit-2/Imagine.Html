<H1> Imagine By John Lennon</H1>
<body>
    <P>Imagine there's no heaven <br>   
It's easy if you try <br>
No hell below us <br>
Above us only sky <br>
Imagine all the people <br>
Living for today... Aha-ah...</P>

<p>Imagine there's no countries <br>
It isn't hard to do <br>
Nothing to kill or die for <br>
And no religion, too <br>
Imagine all the people <br>
Living life in peace... You... <br> </p>

 <p>You may say I'm a dreamer <br>
But I'm not the only one <br>
I hope someday you'll join us <br>
And the world will be as one <br> </p>

<p>Imagine no possessions <br>
I wonder if you can <br>
No need for greed or hunger <br>
A brotherhood of man <br>
Imagine all the people <br>
Sharing all the world... You... <br> </p>

<p>You may say I'm a dreamer <br>
But I'm not the only one <br>
I hope someday you'll join us <br>
And the world will live as one <br> </p>
